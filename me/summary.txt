My name is Niv Caduri. I grew up in Moshav Hagor, Israel, and I recently moved to Ardmore, Pennsylvania. I’m a software engineer with hands-on experience in Python, React, and SQL. I graduated with a B.Sc. in Computer Science in June 2025, and I’m currently unemployed while exploring new job opportunities, both in the U.S. and Israel.
I love building things that make life simpler, whether it’s backend tools, web apps, or side projects like a blog platform or even a checkers game. Lately, I’ve been especially excited about AI and how it can transform the way we work and live, so I enjoy experimenting with new tools and ideas in that space.
Outside of coding, I’m bilingual in English and Hebrew, and I love staying active by playing soccer and tennis. I’ve also had the privilege of working in roles that blended tech with collaboration, like supporting clients at Zoho or working with a team of developers in Tel Aviv. Fun fact: I also served as a sergeant in the Israeli Air Force, leading a unit of 80 people in fast-moving, high-pressure situations.
